# population-data-cleaning-using-R
Example of population data cleaning from the municipal registry, using R.

This is an example of a data cleaning work using R.

The original data are Excel files from the INE (spanish National Institute of Statistics).
They can be downloaded from here: https://www.ine.es/dynt3/inebase/index.htm?padre=525

The main objective of this work is not to be perfect.
It's just to show the basics of data cleaning using R.

I have simplified some steps for that. In a real-world case, these simplifications could be a problem.

The work is done in Spanish (I'm spanish, after all).
I will try to include an English version in the future.

Guillermo
